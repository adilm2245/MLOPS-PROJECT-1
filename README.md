ðŸ“¦ MLOPS Project 1

An end-to-end Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) project demonstrating the integration of data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, deployment, and CI/CD pipelines with Docker and Jenkins.

This project follows best practices in structuring ML projects, ensuring scalability, reproducibility, and automation across the ML lifecycle.


ðŸš€ Features

Data Pipeline: Automated ingestion and preprocessing of raw data.

Model Training: Configurable ML model pipeline with hyperparameter tuning.

Experiment Tracking: Organized artifacts storage (raw, processed, and models).

Web Application: Flask-based UI for model inference.

Containerization: Docker support for consistent deployment.

CI/CD: Jenkins pipeline for automated build, test, and deployment.

Configuration Management: Centralized YAML & Python configs for flexibility.
